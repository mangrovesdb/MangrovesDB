## Blockchain Use-Cases and DeFi Specification

### Problems with centralized finance
Five problems
    • **Centralized control**:
        • Centralized banking system is highly concentrated
        • National central banks control currency
        • Non-financial centralization of tech giants, e.g., Amazon-retail, Facebook/Google-digital advertising
    • **Limited access**:
        • 1.7 billion unbanked
        • Billions underbanked
        • Many entrepreneurs use credit cards to finance their businesses, since banks won’t lend to them because they are small (negative impact on growth)
    • **Inefficiency**:
        • 3% for a credit card swipe
        • 5-7% for a wire transfer
        • 2 days settlement time for a stock transaction
        • Slow transfers of funds
        • Fraud, chargebacks, insecurity
        • No micro transactions
        • Difficult to get paid
    • **Lack of interoperability**:
        • Siloed institutions
        • Difficult to move money from one banking institution to another
        • Difficult to move money from a bank to a non-bank
        • Note: Visa attempted acquisition of fintech company Plaid
    • **Opacity**:
        • Very little transparency
        • Bank customers do not know the health of the bank
        • Must rely on costly regulation and the promise of bailouts


## Bitcoin and cryptocurrency
• Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta (1991) invent the blockchain idea to keep track of time stamping of documents
• Adam Back (2002) invents the Proof of Work idea. It is based on a key paper by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail (require the sender to do a computational task to send the email to you, while this is easy to do once – it is infeasible to do for millions of recipients)
• Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) put these ideas together to introduce bitcoin
