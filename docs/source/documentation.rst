==============================

To use MangrovesDB, you must first create a connection to a between MGDB and the underlying Blockchain Network. The exact process varies by client and the blockchain network. The network can be also designed by the Mangroves engineers, but the very well practiced solution is to connect the MGDB to the currently available blockchain network. 

See the API docs for client-specific details.
