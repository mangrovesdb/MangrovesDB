=======================================

Mangroves is a **SQL layer over any blockchain network**. We proudly focus on simplifying Blockchain development for data analysts, BI, and blockchain developers by leveraging SQL. You can easily read/write data from/to underlying blockchain networks including ``ethereum`` (``on-chain, layer 2``).
